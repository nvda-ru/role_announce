# RoleAnnounce (Element type declaration)

The "Role announce" add-on reads the type of the element under the viewing cursor by pressing the key combination shift+nvda+ q you can hear the following types of elements: Button, link, title, and others. This add-on is useful when you have disabled many similar types of elements.

 NVDA+Shift+Q - "Declare the type of object on which the cursor is installed".

The keyboard shortcut can be changed in the input gestures, in the "Object Type Declaration" category.
